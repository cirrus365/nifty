## Privacy & Security

Nifty is designed with privacy in mind:

- Works in standard Matrix rooms (unencrypted)
- For E2EE support, additional setup with matrix-nio encryption dependencies is required
- Doesn't log personal data beyond conversation context
- Open-source and self-hostable
- Respects user privacy preferences
- Price data is cached locally to minimize API calls

**Note**: This bot currently does not support end-to-end encrypted rooms out of the box. To enable E2EE support, you would need to install additional dependencies and configure the [matrix-nio](https://github.com/matrix-nio/matrix-nio) E2EE plugin.
