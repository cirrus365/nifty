## Privacy & Security

Nifty is designed with privacy in mind:

- Respects user privacy preferences

**Note**: This bot currently does not support end-to-end encrypted rooms out of the box. To enable E2EE support, you would need to install additional dependencies and configure the matrix-nio E2EE plugin.
